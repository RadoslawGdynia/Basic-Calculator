# Basic-Calculator
 
 This repository is made as a simple exercise and documentation of continous development in programming. Main goal was to use design patterns in practice. 
 Implementation of Strategy and Factory method patterns is trivial but works well and addition of new mathematical operations should not present any difficulties and not require changes in methods controlling calculator operation.
